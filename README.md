# Hardware Engineer Interview Questions

Finding hardware engineering jobs is often difficult given the high education barrier to entry, and also the specialization of jobs, which often requires candidates knowing a lot about particular subjects of Electrical and Computer Engineering, which, given the broad scope of the area, makes finding and preparing for jobs especially difficult. The purpose of this repo is to collect some questions in the broad area of hardware, and help you better prepare for your interviews to snag that dream job.
